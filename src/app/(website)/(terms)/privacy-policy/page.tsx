      <h2>12. Notice To California Residents</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The CCPA grants California residents the following rights:</li>
        <li>
          Our Privacy Policy describes how we use and share your personal
          information through the Services, including during the past 12 months.
          The Policy describes:
        </li>
        <li>
          The sources through which we collect California residents’ personal
          information and the types of personal information collected in the
          section 1 above ‘<strong>What</strong> <strong>information</strong>{" "}
          <strong>we</strong> <strong>collect’</strong> and section 2 above{" "}
          <strong>‘Information We Collect Automatically’.</strong> The purposes
          for which we use and share this information in the{" "}
          <strong>’How We Use this Information’</strong> section 3 above and the{" "}
          <strong>’How We Share Information’</strong> section 4 above.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can request a copy of the personal information that we maintain
          about you.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can ask to delete the personal information that we maintain about
          you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some mobile and web browsers transmit "do-not-track" signals. Because
          of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this
          feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals
          to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. We
          currently do not take action in response to these signals.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may exercise your CCPA rights by emailing us at{" "}
          <a href="mailto:rafaelcostapalma@protonmail.com">
            rafaelcostapalma@protonmail.com
          </a>
          . You will need access to the email account associated with your
          Disfruta Paraguay account in order to verify your identity and
          complete this process. Because we only collect limited data about
          individuals without an account, we are unable to verify requests from
          non-account holders to the standard required by the CCPA.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the
          CCPA, including the right to opt-out of any sales or sharing of your
          personal information, to request access to and information about our
          data practices, and to request deletion or correction of your personal
          information, as well as the right not to be discriminated against for
          exercising your privacy rights. Our service does not "sell” or "share”
          personal information as those terms are defined under the CCPA. We do
          not use or disclose sensitive personal information except to provide
          you the Services or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA.
        </li>
        <li>
          California residents can empower an “authorized agent” to submit
          requests on their behalf. We will require authorized agents to confirm
          their identity and authority, in accordance with the CCPA
